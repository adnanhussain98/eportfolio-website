            <p>I have found this module quite enjoyable so far as the HTML and CSS aspect to it is quite straight forward and easy to grasp. I started off with no knowledge of web design and development and now I am able to create the website you are looking at right now.</p>
            
            <p>I am using Brackets to create the HTML and CSS files for my website. I have chosen this application over the alternative ones available as it is simple to use and it has features such as auto-close tags which makes typing in my code faster. 
            
            <p>Although HTML and CSS is easy, I have found it quite tedious at times. An example of this is when I am changing the layout of a page. It is a long process trying to get all the content exacty where I want it as I'm always having to key in different bits of code and go through the process of trial and error.<br>
            My HTML and CSS skills are improving the more I work on this website as I'm always learning new things and I hope that I can showcase what I have learnt through my website.</p>
            
            <p>Here you can see a screenshot of the progress so far on my website. As you can see, i have created two tables in the qualifications page.<img id="website" src="images/website.png" title="Screenshot of my website contruction" alt="Screenshot of website construction" width="720" height="450"></p>

            <h3>ABOUT THE COURSE</h3>
            
            <p>Introduces the modern context of web design and development, the core development technologies and standards and design methods that cater for different current platforms. The key theme of the unit is the efficient design and development of effective and robust websites for the range of popular platforms using the most modern technologies and techniques.</p>
            
            <p>Topics include:</p>
    
            <li>Introduction to the client-server model, web standards, HTML5 semantic mark up, control of presentation via style sheets, interactivity via JavaScript on the client side and PHP on the server side</li>
            <li>The use of high-level tools for design and development</li>
            <li>DOM element selection and manipulation via script libraries such as jQuery</li>
            <li>The production of standards compliant HTML5 video. Students will create dynamic web pages with AMP systems and script on the server side using PHP with MySQL and perform a basic install of a Content Management System such as WordPress. The key theme for scripting will be the understanding and development of readable code that listens for and responds to browser and user events by manipulating DOM elements.</li>
