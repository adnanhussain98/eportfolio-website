This software enables me to create use case diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. It was a bit complicated to use at first as there were many things to consider, such as the different types of cardinalities.</p>
            
            <p>For the group assignment, we were given a case study on Rays Rentals. The end goal for this is to have a fully working database to replace his existing paper based system. As this is a group assignment, it is abit easier to understand what we need to do as everyone is able to collaborate ideas.</p>

            <p>Below, you can see a screenshot of an ERD we created.<img id="erd" src="images/erd.png" title="Rays rentals ERD" alt="Rays rentals ERD" width="720" height="450"></p>
