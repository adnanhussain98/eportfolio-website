            <p>Each week I have learnt something new and have applied it to the portfolio exercises that were set. For example, the first portfolio task asks me to draw a stickman. It was quite simple and took me a few attempts to get the positioning of each body part correct. As the weeks progressed, my coding skills improved drastically as I was able carry out processes such as while loops and if statements.</p>
            
            <p>I found the first few weeks of programming straight forward and quite easy but one thing I struggled on was if statements. I found it a bit difficult to write the correct syntax for an if statement as it could get confusing depending on what the portfolio brief is.</p>
            
            <p>Below, you can see a screenshot of the stickman portfolio task that I completed in the first week.<img id="stickman" src="images/stickman.png" title="Stickman portfolio task" alt="Stickman portfolio task" width="720" height="450"></p>

            <h3>ABOUT THE COURSE</h3>
            
            <p>This unit introduces computer programming in a high level programming language and includes principles and practice in problem solving, program design, solution implementation and testing, including:</p>
    
                <li>Introduction to programming using Java</li>
                <li>Software life cycle: importance of correctly identifying the problem, iterative nature of software development, software maintenance</li>
                <li>Design methodology: the application of the top-down design method using step-wise refinement to produce pseudo-code solutions to problems, incorporating constructs for sequence selection, iteration, abstraction and re-use</li>
                <li>Verification and testing: the use of desk-top execution, simple debugging strategies and more formal approaches to testing e.g. black box white box boundary analysis and equivalence classes</li>
                <li>Applications of standards and conventions: software maintenance and developing a professional approach to coding</li>
                <li>Constructs and features of a structured high level programming language: control constructs, operators, procedural abstraction, simple I/O and use of libraries</li>
                <li>Data types – primitive types: constants, variables, arrays and simple structured data</li>
                <li>Object orientated design and implementation: inheritance and polymorphism</li>
                <li>Software support environment: use of an IDE editors compiler/linkers and operating systems</li>
