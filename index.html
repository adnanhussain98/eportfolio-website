            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        
            <p><img class="me" src="images/adnan.jpg" alt="Picture of me on the right" width="401" height="735">My name is Adnan Hussain and I am an 18 year old student studying Software
            Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University. I am currently a first year student
            and I am new to the world of programming languages. I'm hoping to learn and apply the things I will learn in my course and I'm hoping to succeed in a Software Engineering career.</p>
            
            <p>Prior to attending university, I studied A Levels at the Oldham Sixth Form College. I studied English Language, Media Studies and ICT. I wasn't too keen on the subjects I studied in college as it involved a lot of written work and that didn't really excite me. I prefer learning about the software behind the technology we use today as it's evolving rapidly and I want to be a part of that and see what opportunities it creates for me.</p>
            
            <p>In the following pages, you will be able to see how I am getting on with university and my reflection on the academic year so far. I will also be showcasing some of the work I have done so far and my latest qualifications up to this date. </p>
        
            <p>For more information on the course I am studying, <a href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2017/14133/" title="Software Engineering at MMU">visit the MMU website.</a></p> <!-- Link to an external page. -->
