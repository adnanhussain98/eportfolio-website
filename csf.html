            <p>This module is quite different to the other modules i'm studying as it is split into two components. There's the digital logic and assembly language programming and then there's mathematics involved aswell.</p>
            
            <p><img id="logisim" src="images/logisim.png" title="Logisim logo" alt="Logisim logo" width="150" height="150">I found the first few weeks of CSF quite easy as we were learning about logic gates, which I have learnt about in school when chose the Electronics course. We used the program Logisim to simulate digital logic circuits and we were able to find out the truth tables and boolean expressions of any circuits we built.
            
            <p>In mathematics so far we have covered sets, matrices and vectors. There are a lot of rules that you must learn and understand and that's the only struggle I'm having as sometimes, I find it difficult to know which rule I should apply to the question given. This is something I will practice so that I can complete the assignment that will be given out to complete.
            
            <p>In the screenshot below, you can see the types of questions that come up in the mini test for mathematics.<img id="maths" src="images/maths.png" title="Stickman portfolio task" alt="Stickman portfolio task" width="720" height="450"></p>

            <h3>ABOUT THE COURSE</h3>
            
            <p>This unit provides an introduction to the fundamental principles and mathematics underpinning the design and construction of computer systems, including:</p>
    
            <li>Digital Logic and Boolean Algebra: digital logic gates and circuits, Karnaugh maps, use of a digital logic circuit simulator, components of a CPU, processor model, Fetch execute cycle, hardware interrupts</li>
            <li>Assembly Language Programming: relationship between high level languages and assembler, instruction sets, registers, debugging</li>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics: matrices and vectors, matrices as linear transforms</li>
            <li>Functions: definition, properties</li>
            <li>Sets: subsets, set algebra</li>
            <li>Logic: propositions, predicates, propositional algebra, proof of simple results</li>
