            <h2>SELF ASSESSMENT</h2> 
            
            <p>Through education and employment, I have been able to develop skills such as, communication, teamwork, leadership, and problem solving skills. Through continuing to develop these attributes, I will be able to pursue graduate jobs, where employers are seeking for these skills.</p>
 
            <p>During my employment at Manchester United, I worked as a waiter as part of the catering team. Being a waiter entailed a lot of interaction with the customers, therefore, I gained a rapport with the customers and maintained good etiquette. An example being, asking the customer if they are happy with their meal, or if they need anything else. By being attentive, it made the customers experience more pleasant and friendly, by showing that they will receive the best customer service possible. Also, this experience developed my communication skills, as during a busy service, it was highly important to effectively communicate with my fellow colleagues in the catering team so that every customer receives the correct meal, and with it being on time.</p>  
 
            <p>Also, during my employment at Manchester United, I have worked in the private VIP boxes. This entailed in on match days, accompanying the customer and catering to all their needs. This included providing a full three course meal, including drinks and refreshments throughout the match. Working in VIP boxes required me in providing excellent hospitality, such as being courteous and friendly towards the customers whilst providing their meals or drink. Also, time management was key, whereby it was important to get the orders from the customers before the game kicks off so that they can receive the meal before the match starts. So, this also required communicating clearly with the team, so that all orders went through on time and that all orders were delivered on time.</p>

            <p>At my current employment, I have been working at the Shop Direct Warehouse as part of the packing team. This role involves being given hourly targets that we have to meet. Personally, I am able to do the same repetitive task during a long period of time without getting bored or losing focus, so, this has aided me in being able to meet the targets at every hour. The challenging aspect to this role is that, at times, certain items will be missing, therefore, I take the initiative to search where the items are before reporting it to the missing item area. Moreover, through my organisation skills, I am able sort out the the items into their relevant areas, which has helped me to efficiently process large quantities of items that come through.</p>

            <p>Also, during my studies at sixth form, I was able to demonstrate my leadership skills, through leading a team for a project where we had the task of creating a short film. This project entailed in extensive research and preparation on the subject matter, location, and the technology that will be going to use. Whilst leading the group, I had allocated roles to people. This was challenging, as whilst I had to do my work as part of the team, I had to also communicate with the others regularly to ensure that they are fulfilling their roles on time. For example, I ensured that one person researched the dress code for the situation in the film, whilst another person researched appropriate locations and booked certain places where we can film. Therefore, as the leader, I ensured that we worked efficiently as a team so that we can deliver well for the project.</p>
